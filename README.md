This is my second iteration creating a replica of Airbnb.
The goal for this project is to migrate into using Golang and follow the test driven development approach.

## Intro

I created a replica called nextbnb in the past and now I am starting a new one by taking approaches I have regretted not taking for the past project. I have experienced numerous pain points as the project got bigger. Some of the pain points were the following:

- [ ] Creating duplicate components unnecessarily
- [ ] Gathering all the code in one file for multiple purposes (this can result in slow performance on the browser)
- [ ] Not using React hooks effectively for optimized performance

To fix these problems I decided to take a complete different development flow. I focused into component driven development and a more test driven approach.
