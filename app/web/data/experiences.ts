      'This experience is a magic show that takes place in my home. I like to think of it as a “backstage” tour. We’ll warm up with some interactive magic tricks where you’ll follow my instructions and use items in your own homes to fool yourselves. Then I’ll show you my favorite books and magic gadgets and tell you funny stories about their authors and creators. You might get a glimpse at the latest wacky project in my workshop or find out how I handle everyday tasks with a magical flourish. Finally, I’ll settle down at my practice table and put on a show of sleight-of-hand magic performed extremely close-up. Right from where you are, you’ll be able to pick cards, check my sleeves, and shuffle the deck. And you’re guaranteed the best seat in the house. Great for Groups. (NB while you will learn one simple magic trick, this experience is primarily a show and not a class.)',
